# **🎥 SimpleRec - Movie Recommendation System**

## 📖 Project Overview

SimpleRec is a Flask-based movie recommendation system that provides users with suggestions for movies based on their search inputs. The system fetches data from TMDB (The Movie Database) and displays interactive movie posters. Clicking on a poster redirects users to a streaming platform for easy access.

## 📊 Recommendation Engine Details

The recommendation system uses the following approach:

1. **Data Fetching:**

   - Fetches popular movies from TMDB API.
   - Stores and processes movie details such as title, genres, and overview.

2. **Feature Extraction:**

   - Combines genres, overview, and release date for vectorization.

3. **Vectorization:**

   - Utilizes TF-IDF vectorizer to represent movie features.

4. **Similarity Calculation:**

   - Computes cosine similarity using `linear_kernel` to find similar movies.
